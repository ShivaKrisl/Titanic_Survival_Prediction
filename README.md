About Dataset
The data set has 3 csv files named 'full.csv', 'train.csv',and 'test.csv'. The train and test csv files were created from full.csv after data preprocessing

However in this problem we are going to start from scratch. I'm going to use only 'full.csv' and do all the neccessary steps to build a perfect model
