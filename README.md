# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
Titanic Survival Prediction is a classical Classification Problem. You can the dataset on kaagle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavlofesenko/titanic-extended.

About Dataset
The data set has 3 csv files named 'full.csv', 'train.csv',and 'test.csv'. The train and test csv files were created from full.csv after data preprocessing

However in this problem we are going to start from scratch. I'm going to use only 'full.csv' and do all the neccessary steps to build a perfect model.

Data set Description:
The first 12 features are the same as in the Titanic competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

The last 9 features are added from the Titanic passenger list on Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passengers_of_the_RMS_Titanic) and are as follows:

WikiId
Name
Age
Hometown
Boarded
Destination
Lifeboat
Body
Class
The new features are very similar to the original ones but they are more up-to-date and have much fewer missing values. Therefore, users can decide on the preferred features themselves.
