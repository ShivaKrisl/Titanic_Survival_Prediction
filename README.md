# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
Titanic Survival Prediction is a classical Classification Problem. You can the find dataset on kaagle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavlofesenko/titanic-extended.

About Dataset
The data set has 3 csv files named 'full.csv', 'train.csv',and 'test.csv'. The train and test csv files were created from full.csv after data preprocessing

However in this problem we are going to start from scratch. I'm going to use only 'full.csv' and do all the neccessary steps to build a perfect model.

Data set Description:
The first 12 features are the same as in the Titanic competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

The last 9 features are added from the Titanic passenger list on Wikipedia(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passengers_of_the_RMS_Titanic) and are as follows:

1. WikiId
2. Name
3. Age
4. Hometown
5. Boarded
6. Destination
7. Lifeboat
8. Body
9. Class

The new features are very similar to the original ones but they are more up-to-date and have much fewer missing values. Therefore, users can decide on the preferred features themselves.

Steps to build a model:
Inorder to build a ML model here I have follwed the following steps:
1. importing the required libraries(pandas,matplotlib,sklearn,etc)
2. importing the data
3. Data preprocessing
4. Exploratory Data Analysis
5. Model Training
6. Model Evaluation

Note = here I have used Jupyter Environment in order to use it offline you need to download jupyter from https://jupyter.org/install
and also the required libraries used in the code from official documentaions
1. https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/
2. https://seaborn.pydata.org/
3. https://matplotlib.org/
4. https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html
